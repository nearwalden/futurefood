Where we've evolved to: mass production model

* quest to remove variability

food as a product

* engineer's view of food

* battle against variability

* arc of history of food

How food is engineered

* growing environment \(soil, weather, weeding\)

* plants

* goes back to earliest deliberate agriculture

Nature fights back

* weather

* evolved resistance

* imperfection of genetic reproduction

* soil

* genes jump ship

* genetic brittleness, monoculture

* human variability

* weeds

* microbiome

* example: end of bananas

Imperfections/variability = waste

* leeching chemicals

* genetic spillover

* damaged food

* wrong time to market
