# The Future of Farming





Where we've evolved to: mass production model

* quest to remove variability

Rise of the robots

Nature fights back

* weather

* evolved resistance

* imperfection of genetic reproduction

* soil

* genes jump ship

* genetic brittleness, monoculture

* human variability

* weeds

* microbiome

* example: end of bananas

Imperfections/variability = waste

* leeching chemicals

* genetic spillover

* damaged food

* wrong time to market

Return of natures tricks

* cover crops

* variation

* "precision ag"

Indoor growing

* much of variability can go away

* not just for plants

Food as chemistry

* vat grown

* remove role of genetics
