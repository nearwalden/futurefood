# The History and Future of Food from 50,000 Feet

In Daniel Suarez's recent novel, "Change Agent", set in the 2040's, the main character is a _degan_, or someone who eats meat, but only "deathless meat".  While the concept of someone identifying as a degan may have a science-fictiony twist, the idea of vat-grown meat is hardly science fiction.  Even today, in 2017, multiple companies are hard at work producing cultured meat.

All of what we historically consider food, whether plant- or animal-based, is, at its core, chemicals.  That we could eventually figure out the chemical makeup of foods and replace cellular process and recipes stored in DNA with direct chemical processes and recipes stored in computers feels inevitable.

If this were the only disruptive concept in food, it would be plenty.  But indoor farming has also gained serious traction recently, and genetic manipulation of plants and animals appears on the verge of another revolution with the advent of CRISPR technology. Combined with vat-grown-food these point to disruptive, technology-driven change in our food systems.

Turning from technical to cultural trends, we face a startling contrast.  Culturally we seem to be headed in the opposite direction:  "organic", "grow local", and "heritage varieties" hearken back to earlier periods and methods.  Even as food production threatens to disconnect from its historical roots, food consumption 

How does this work out going forward?  Do we bifurcate into a warring "future food" and "past food" clans, or do these coexist in a new, more diverse food system?  The first step to understanding the answer to these questions is to see how we got to this point.

## How We Got Here:  Food Production

The primary focus of manufacturing process improvement is to remove variation.  Pure inputs, precise operations and uniform outputs are the target.  Major US companies like Motorola and GE even popularized the statistical measure of variability by using it in the name for their quality initiatives:  six sigma, indicating a process that has achieved less than one fault per XXX.

The concept of improvement through minimizing variation accurately describes the historic arc of all farming, whether plant or animal, going back 1000's of years.  When some plants crowd each other out, we plant so that each has the same space.  When unwanted plants steal resources, we weed so that a field has a single species.  When rain is irregular we irrigate.  When swings in temperature threaten animals we provide climate-controlled environments.  When pasture variations produce different sized animals we produce herd-optimized animal foods.  When humans don't drive tractors in perfectly straight lines

Of course over time science has advanced, and we've learned more about what makes plants and animals grow well, and inevitably this new information is applied to the reduction of variability.  Carefully controlled genetics give us predictable, uniformity of the timing of plant maturity.  Antibiotics restrict the microbiome to a "favorable" state.  Chemical fertilizers create uniform nutrients in across fields, often at levels never achieved naturally. DNA-based features and super drugs help fight off wide varieties of pests.

When combined with the efficiency improvements from mechanization, the increases in production and decreases in cost are truly amazing.  \(include some here?\)  Land use, sustainability, also improved by many measures.

If the story ended here it would be a happy one, but its not surprising that major issues have emerged.  While we seek to stomp out variation and create homogeneity, nature seems to want the opposite.  Even ignoring climate shifts, the variation in weather still periodically ravages crops.  Mutations build resistance to the chemical and genetic defenses that we create, rendering them useless, and potentially irreplaceable. Examples:  sea lice, antibiotic resistance\)

Our quest for homogeneity has led to monoculture and made the plant and animal species more fragile in a genetic sense.  Example:  bananas.

Finally, we're hitting resource limits, and our methods are not without side effects.  Examples:  water left in US aquafers, and chemical overspill.

In the end we have made tremendous headway and more is possible, but system is not nearly as robust as you would logically think it would be.

## How We Got Here:  Food Consumption

Hunting and gathering ==&gt; domesticated agriculature ==&gt; industrial agriculture \(note fish\)

Cooking as creatively making use of what you can get.  Regional.

Rising incomes, mobility, fast tood.

Role of marketing in food.

Maslov's heirarchy of needs

Cultural pushback:  anti-GMO, organic, sustainability, local

Rebirth of desire to farm

Rise of foodie-ism

The chemistry of cooking, sous ? cooking

Variety, range

Branding+causes:  free-range, anti-biotic free, etc
